# Tech Test - Ticket Sales

This is a quick tech test to simulate a ticket sales experience. To reserve a ticket, a name must be supplied. There are only five tickets available and no particular name can have more than one ticket.

When a ticket is reserved, it is automatically dereserved after five minutes if it is not paid for.
